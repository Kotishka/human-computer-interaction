## Chapter 1. Design of Everyday Things

Some doors are confusing. These are called [Norman Doors](https://uxdesign.cc/intro-to-ux-the-norman-door-61f8120b6086), named after the author of this book [Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman).

Two important characteristics of design.

- **Discoverability**: Is it possible to figure out what actions are possible and how to perform them?
- **Understanding**: What does it mean? How should the product be used?

A door that looks like it should be pulled but should actually be pushed, is a failure of discoverability. Instead of a handle you can put a metal plate where the door should be pushed.

### Complexity of Modern Devices

Don Norman complains about how complex modern appliances can be.

- **Industrial design**: Emphasizes form and material
- **Interaction design**: Focuses on how people interact with technology
- **Experience design**: Focuses on emotional impact of experience

Machines can be confusing. Engineers might think that users should just read the instructions, but users are not so simple. It is worthwhile to understand the users. Don Norman found that the [Three Mile Island accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident) had been attributed to "human error" when in reality the control room was poorly designed.

### Human-Centered Design

Human-Centered Design is

> ... an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. _- Don Norman_

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

Designers produce experiences. Experiences are what is important.

The five fundamental psychological concepts

- affordances
  - an affordance is what you can do with an object. Can you drink it? Can you pick it up? Can you sit in it?
  * affordances are a relationship between an object and an "agent" (agent is usually a person, but it could be a cat or a robot)
  * Affordances exist even if they are not visible.
- signifiers
  - signifiers indicate the affordances of an object, whether the affordance is planned or accidental (flags can tell the direction of the wind even if this isn't the purpose of flags).
  * signifiers must be perceivable.
  * signifiers are more important to designers than affortdances
- constraints
- mappings
- feedback

The sixth and possibly most important is

- conceptual model of the system
